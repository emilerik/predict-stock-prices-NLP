The Company reported net earnings of $2.0 million , or $0.48 per common share, on revenues of $467.9 million for the third quarter of 2018 , compared to a net loss of $3.0 million , or $(0.72) per common share, on revenues of $295.3 million for the third quarter of 2017 .

Adjusted net (losses) earnings, adjusted (losses) earnings per common share and adjusted cash flow are non-generally accepted accounting principle (“non-GAAP”) financial measures that are defined and reconciled in the financial tables below. Third Quarter 2018 Highlights: • Gross revenues of approximately $467.9 million for the third quarter of 2018 compared to $295.3 million for the third quarter of 2017 • Our crude oil marketing subsidiary, GulfMark Energy, Inc., marketed approximately 70,635 per day (“bpd”) of crude oil during the third quarter of 2018 , compared to 64,104 bpd of crude oil during the third quarter of 2017 • Cash and cash equivalents increased by 20 per cent from December 31, 2017 levels of $109.4 million to $130.8 million at September 30, 2018 • $59.6 million of undrawn capacity under our letter of credit facility at September 30, 2018 • A djusted cash flow of $4.2 million for the third quarter of 2018 compared to $2.3 million for the third quarter of 2017 • Approximately 476,703 barrels of crude oil inventory at September 30, 2018 compared to 198,011 barrels at December 31, 2017 • Dividend of $0.22 per share for the third quarter of 2018 • No short or long term debt as of September 30, 2018 1 “During the third quarter of 2018 , our Service Transport business unit continued to generate improved financial and operating results as our revenue per mile increased 1 percent from the second quarter of 2018 and 21 percent from the third quarter of 2017,” said Townes G. Pressler, Executive Chairman. “As customer demand continues to be strong in this segment, improv ed trucking rates allow improved hiring and retention of skilled drivers as we continue to provide dependable superior service to our customers at Service Transport. We are continuing on s chedule with improv ing the age of our fleet, with the purchase of 40 new tractors through Sept ember 30, 2018 and commitments to purchase an additional 61 tractors and 20 trailers by the end of the fir st quarter of 2019 . ” “At our GulfMark business unit , crude oil marketing volumes for the third quarter of 2018 were consistent with the second quarter of 2018 and increased 10 percent from the third quarter of 2017, primarily as a result of increased production in our market areas. Our overall marketing margins have increased as a result of the exit of areas with thin margins.” “During the remainder of 2018, we will remain focused on introducing efficiencies in our crude oil marketing division , int egrating our crude oil gathering company acquisition into our busine ss , replac ing aging tractors and right sizing our tractor and trailer fleets in both business units , improving company-wide driver retention and increasing driver count, and placing safety first in all of our operations. We will continue to explor e syne rgic growth opportunities in our core businesses, both organically and in the open market,” continued Pressler. Capital Investments and Dividends During the third quarter of 2018 , the Company recorded approximately $5.0 million of capital costs and paid dividends of $0.9 million ( $0.22 per share). The majority of the capital costs relate to the purchase of tractors in our Service Transport subsidiary. The Company’s Board of Directors also declared a quarterly cash dividend for the third quarter of 2018 in the amount of $0.22 per common share, payable on December 21, 2018 to shareholders of record as of December 7, 2018. Use of Non-G AAP Financia l Measures This press release and accompanying schedules includes the non-GAAP financial measures of adjusted cash flow, adjusted net (losses) earnings and adjusted (losses) earnings per common share. The accompanying schedules provide definitions of these non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations to their most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Company management uses these measurements as aids in monitoring the Company’s ongoing financial performance from quarter to quarter and year to year on a regular basis and for benchmarking against peer companies. Our non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as alternatives to GAAP measures such as net income, operating income, net cash flow provided by operating activities or any other measure of financial performance calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Our non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures of other companies because they may not calculate such measures in the same manner as we do.
